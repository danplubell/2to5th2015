# Calculation of Glomerular Filtration Rate by CKiD Schwartz method

# Why is GFR Important
The GFR is an important measurement for estimating kidney function.

GFR estimation is based on the clearance of molecules from the blood serum by the kidneys.

Methods that are used for adults are not accurate for children.

The accuracy of GFR estimationis improved by the  CKiD Schwartz method because it uses Serum Creatinine and Cystatin C.
